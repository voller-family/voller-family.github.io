Arntson</h1> <h2 >1946 - 2015</h2></div> <p class='desc'>House of Voller biography for John Arntson, 1946 - 2015. Born to Wayne and Elizabeth Arntson. Married to Pam Arntson. Parent to Chad and Brady.</p> <div class='column large'><h3 >Obituary</h3> <p>John W. Arntson, of Colfax, passed away at home on Friday, June 12, 2015 from pancreatic cancer at the age of 68. John was born to Wayne and Elizabeth (Brunner) Arntson on September 16, 1946.</p> <p>He attended Colfax Elementary School and graduated from Colfax High School in 1964. After graduation, he attended Dunwoody Institute in Minneapolis receiving a machinist degree in 1966. He entered the US Navy in December of that year and spent the next 4 years serving on West-Pac cruises to The Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Viet Nam, Hawaii and more.</p> <p>On June 7, 1969 he married Pam Peterson, the girl next door, and they began their 46 years of marriage together at the San Diego Naval Station. After discharge they returned to Wisconsin and John worked as a machinist in Eau Claire and Menomonie, becoming machine and production manager for the last few years at MRM Elgin Corp. When the plant was sold, he finished out his work career at Cardinal Glass Co. in Menomonie.</p> <p>John and Pam raised two awesome sons and he treasured every moment with them. John enjoyed hunting, fishing and playing golf with his boys and also helping them out with various building and repair projects or just hanging out.</p> <p>After the boys married, we gained wonderful daughters-in-law and then came our grandchildren, who were the apples of Grandpa’s eyes. John and Pam enjoyed attending Colfax Viking Sporting events. They also liked to go on day trips to shop, visit, or just drive. They took up kayaking just a few years ago and loved their time on the water. Of course, golf was a big part of John’s retirement. He went early almost every morning from Spring until late Fall. He enjoyed friendships with so many people at Whitetail Golf Course. We called it his second home. During the winter months, his early mornings took him to Cenex for coffee, where he enjoyed another set of good buddies. Together they took on all sorts of topics and no doubt solved many world problems, to their satisfaction.</p> <p>John is survived by his wife, Pam, sons, Chad and Lori Arntson, their children, Elizabeth and Andrew. Brady and Deanna Arntson, their children, Caleb and Conner. One sister, Jane and Keith Hanson. Two brothers, Jerry and Betty Arntson. Ken and Suzanne Arntson. Mother-in-law, Phyllis Peterson, Brothers- in–Law, Jeffrey and Kaaren Peterson and Craig and Terri Peterson. Several Nieces and Nephews, aunts and cousins, friendsvc c v and close friend Steve Kaiser. He was preceded in death by his parents, grandparents, brother, Ed, and father-in-law, Clifford Peterson.</p> <p>John has found a new “golf course” to par in the company of the angels and God, His Heavenly Father.</p> <h3 >Family</h3> <h4 class="field top">Parents</h4> <div class="field"><div class='h5 label'>Father: </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/arntson-father/'>Wayne Arntson</a></div> <div class="field"><div class='h5 label'>Mother: </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/arntson-mother/'>Elizabeth Arntson</a></div> <div class="field top"><div class='h4 label'>Spouse: </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/pam-artnson/'>Pam Arntson</a></div> <h4 class="field top">Children</h4><div class="field"><div class='h5 label'> - </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/chad-arntson/'>Chad Arntson</a></div><div class="field"><div class='h5 label'> - </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/brady-arntson/'>Brady Arntson</a></div> <h3 >Life Events</h3> <div class='events'><div class='date h4'>1946-09-16</div> <h4 class="event-header">Birth</h4> <p>Born on Monday, September 16, 1946 to <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/arntson-father/">Wayne Arntson</a> and <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/arntson-mother/">Elizabeth Arntson</a>.</p> <div class='date h4'>1969-06-07</div> <h4 class="event-header">Marriage</h4> <p>Married <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/pam-artnson/">Pam Arntson</a> on Saturday, June 7, 1969 in Burnett, Wisconsin, United States (age 22).</p> <div class='date h4'>2015-06-12</div> <h4 class="event-header">Death</h4> <p>Died on Friday, June 12, 2015 in Colfax, Wisconsin, United States (age 68).</p></div></div> <div class='column small'><img class='headshot' src='https://voller-family.github.io/assets/img/headshots/unknown.png'> <a href='https://voller-family.github.io/pedigree?node=john-artnson' class='button'><div class='shadow h6'><i class='fa-solid fa-sitemap'></i>View in Pedigree</div></a></div></div></div> <div class='site-head'><div class='pane'><div class='title'>House of Voller</div> <div class='nav'><a href="https://voller-family.github.io/" title="Home" >Home</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/history/" title="History" >History</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/" title="Biographies" >Biographies</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/recipes/" title="Recipes" >Recipes</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/pedigree/" title="Pedigree" >Pedigree</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/map/" title="Map" >Map</a></div></div></div></body> </html>
