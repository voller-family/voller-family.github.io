Born in Huntley, Illinois to Max Miller and Elsie Korn.</p> <div class='column large'><h3 >Obituary</h3> <p>Donald Abraham Miller of Corvallis died Tuesday at Heart of the Valley Health Care Center. He was 82.</p> <p>He was born to Max and Elsie Miller Abraham in Huntley, Ill., and raised on a dairy farm in rural Illinois. He attended a one-room schoolhouse until high school. He graduated from high school at age 16. He received a bachelor's degree in history from Northwestern University and a master's degree in social work from Washington State University. He served in the Navy from February 1942 to October of 1946, and was stationed at the Navy's port facilities in Shanghai, China. He was promoted from yeoman to first lieutenant.</p> <p>He was director of the Children's Farm Home for more than two decades until his retirement in 1984. He served on the Corvallis School Board from 1984 until 1997, and was chairman from 1986 to 1987 and was vice-chairman twice.</p> <p>Barbara Ross served on the school board with Miller and knew him since the 1970s, when he worked at the Children's Farm Home.</p> <p>Don was a person of complete integrity," Ross said. "He was very calm, but when he believed in something he knew was right, he chose his words carefully and quite deliberately in standing up for things where he thought his voice was needed.</p> <p>Children were a big part of Miller's life, Ross said, as was shown by his work at the Children's Farm Home and time on the school board. It also carried over to his family, as Ross recalled Miller frequently discussing his grandchildren with her.</p> <p>Ross, a former state legislator, said Miller also backed cause he believed in, whether it was going door-to-door for the Democratic party for a candidate or giving his time and money to other organizations.</p> <p>"He never acted as if he was too good to do small work," Ross said.</p> <p>He was in the midst of collecting signatures to get an initiative on the ballot for single-payer health insurance coverage for all Oregonians.</p> <p>He married Beatrice Anderson June 11, 1949, in Evanston, Ill.</p> <p>He was a member of the Episcopal Church of the Good Samaritan and the Sino-American Co-op organization. His hobbies were gardening, making jam, cooking, music and dancing. He was known as an extremely fast berry picker.</p> <p>Survivors include his wife; daughters, Martha Yazhari of Belle Maed, N.J., Cindy Miller Aron of Corvallis and Angie Beer of Portland; adopted daughter, Rose Barber of San Francisco; sisters, Alice Voller of Marengo, Ill., and Maxine Wightman of Littleton, Colo.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</p> <h3 >Family</h3> <h4 class="field top">Parents</h4> <div class="field"><div class='h5 label'>Father: </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/max-miller/'>Max Miller</a></div> <div class="field"><div class='h5 label'>Mother: </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/elsie-korn/'>Elsie Catherine Korn</a></div> <div class="field top"><div class='h4 label'>Spouse: </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/beatrice-miller/'>Beatrice Marie Miller</a></div> <h4 class="field top">Children</h4><div class="field"><div class='h5 label'> - </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/cindy-aron/'>Cindy Miller Aron</a></div><div class="field"><div class='h5 label'> - </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/rose-barber/'>Rose Barber</a></div><div class="field"><div class='h5 label'> - </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/angie-beer/'>Angie Beer</a></div><div class="field"><div class='h5 label'> - </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/martha-yazhari/'>Martha Yazhari</a></div> <h3 >Life Events</h3> <div class='events'><div class='date h4'>1919-02-05</div> <h4 class="event-header">Birth</h4> <p>Born on Wednesday, February 5, 1919 to <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/max-miller/">Max Miller</a> and <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/elsie-korn/">Elsie Korn</a> in Huntley, Illinois, United States.</p> <div class='date h4'>1949-06-11</div> <h4 class="event-header">Marriage</h4> <p>Married <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/beatrice-miller/">Beatrice Miller</a> on Saturday, June 11, 1949 in Evanston, Illinois, United States (age 30).</p> <div class='date h4'>1977-06-23</div> <h4 class="event-header">Mother Death</h4> <p>Mother, <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/elsie-korn/">Elsie Korn</a>, died on Thursday, June 23, 1977 in Belvidere, Illinois, United States (age 58).</p> <div class='date h4'>2001-08-07</div> <h4 class="event-header">Death</h4> <p>Died on Tuesday, August 7, 2001 in Corvallis, Oregon, United States (age 82).</p></div></div> <div class='column small'><img class='headshot' src='https://voller-family.github.io/assets/img/headshots/unknown.png'> <a href='https://voller-family.github.io/pedigree?node=don-miller' class='button'><div class='shadow h6'><i class='fa-solid fa-sitemap'></i>View in Pedigree</div></a> <div class='urls'></div></div></div></div> <div class='site-head'><div class='pane'><div class='title'>House of Voller</div> <div class='nav'><a href="https://voller-family.github.io/" title="Home" >Home</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/history/" title="History" >History</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/bio/" title="Biographies" >Biographies</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/recipes/" title="Recipes" >Recipes</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/pedigree/" title="Pedigree" >Pedigree</a> <a href="https://voller-family.github.io/map/" title="Map" >Map</a></div></div></div></body> </html>
