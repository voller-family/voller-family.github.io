Parent to Charles.</p> <div class='column large'><h3 >Obituary</h3> <p>Harold William Weeks, of Harvard, IL and Sharon, WI was born March 5, 1922 in Sharon, Wisconsin to Charles Brace and Vera Minna (Vesper) Weeks. He passed away on Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at his home in rural Harvard.</p> <p>Harold was a lifelong resident of Sharon, Wisconsin, where he farmed his entire life. He lived to see the evolution of agriculture from horses, to the modern technology of 500 horse-power engine tractors. He planted fields with a one-row corn planter and saw his sons do the same with 36-row planters. When he was no longer actively engaged in farming, his greatest joy was to park his car in the field (sometimes in the way!), and watch his sons and grandsons continue what he had started so many years before. His love of nature and the outdoors continued as he enjoyed mowing lawns at the farm, the church, and anywhere else that needed it.</p> <p>Harold married Helen (Cates) on October 2, 1946, he was a devoted father, grandfather, great grandfather and friend to many.</p> <p>He is survived by his sons, Charles Weeks, David (Judie) Weeks, William (Betty) Weeks, Donald (Debbie) Weeks; his grandchildren, Patrick Weeks, Brace (Crystal) Weeks, Lucas (Becky) Weeks, Brett (Suzy) Weeks, Carrie (Shawn) Vorpagel, Ron Weeks, Nick (Anabel) Weeks, Rachel Weeks, Tyler Young, and Lyndsey Young; as well as 14 great grandchildren.</p> <p>Harold was preceded in death by his parents, his wife Helen, Siblings Arvin, Betty, and Dorothy.</p> <p>A visitation will be held on Sunday, March 19, 2017 from 2:00 to 5:00 PM at Toynton's Sharon Funeral Home, 210 Baldwin, Sharon, WI and again on Monday at Sharon United Methodist Church, 225 Baldwin, Sharon, WI from 10:00 AM until the time of service at 11:00 AM. Burial will follow at Oakwood Cemetery in Sharon.</p> <p>In lieu of other expressions of sympathy, memorials may be made to the United Methodist Church, 225 Baldwin St., Sharon, WI 53585.</p> <p>God looked down on the earth He created and said, "I need a caretaker for this world I have made." And so, God made a farmer.</p> <h3 >Family</h3> <div class="field top"><div class='h4 label'>Spouse: </div><a class='h5 val' href='https://voller-family.github.io/bio/helen-weeks/'>Helen M.
